- Real-time collaboration between roles

### 2. Multi-level Approval Workflows
- **SWS (Employee) → Manager → Project Manager**
- **Procurement Staff → Manager → Project Manager**
- **Document Analyst → Manager → Project Manager**
- Real-time status updates throughout the approval chain

### 3. Role-based Access Control
- **Admin**: Full system access, user management, system monitoring
- **Manager**: Approval workflows, project oversight, analytics
- **Project Manager**: Project management, resource allocation, progress tracking
- **Employee**: Inventory management, RFID scanning, delivery tracking
- **Procurement Staff**: Purchase orders, supplier management, procurement requests
- **Maintenance Staff**: Asset tracking, maintenance scheduling, equipment monitoring
- **Document Analyst**: Document verification, budget proposals, receipt management

### 4. Comprehensive Audit Logging
- All user actions are logged with timestamps
- Data changes are tracked with before/after values
- System activities are monitored in real-time
- Security events are logged and monitored

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **users**: User management with roles and permissions
- **projects**: Project tracking with real-time updates

- **Workflow notifications** for pending actions

## Security Implementation

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **User-specific data access** based on roles
- **Secure approval workflows** with proper permissions
- **Audit trail protection** with read-only access
- **Data integrity checks** with constraints

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Role-based permissions** for all operations
- **Session management** with proper cleanup
- **Activity logging** for security monitoring
- **Data access controls** with RLS policies

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Optimizations
- **Indexes** on frequently queried columns
- **Connection pooling** for better performance
- **Query optimization** with proper joins
- **Data pagination** for large datasets

### Real-time Optimizations
- **Selective subscriptions** based on user roles
- **Event filtering** to reduce unnecessary updates
- **Connection management** with automatic cleanup
- **Error handling** with retry mechanisms

## Error Handling & Monitoring

### Comprehensive Error Handling
- **Database connection errors** with fallback mechanisms
- **Real-time subscription errors** with automatic reconnection
- **User permission errors** with proper messaging
- **Data validation errors** with user feedback

### Monitoring & Logging
- **System performance metrics** with real-time monitoring
- **Error logging** with detailed stack traces
- **User activity tracking** for security auditing
- **Database performance monitoring** with query analysis

## Development & Testing

### Development Setup
1. **Environment configuration** with proper variables
2. **Database migrations** with version control
3. **Seed data** for development and testing
4. **Local development** with Supabase CLI

### Testing Strategy
